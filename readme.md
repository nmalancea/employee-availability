### Assumptions
1. Outside of custom availability hours, company hours will be used.
2. Availabilities are given in sorted order.
3. Availabilities have no overlap.

### Running

```shell
node availability.js 1 12/29/2015 01/02/2016
```

Alternatively you can uncomment a sample test at the bottom of `availability.js` and simply run `node availability.js`.
